### Notes on Data Source  
**Information Absent**:  
- Information is not held regarding the characteristics of the defendant except for age,
gender, ethnicity, and whether they are a person or corporation. Information
regarding the defendant that is NOT held includes, but is not limited to:  
a. Nationality,  
b. Occupation,  
c. Social class,  
d. Location of residence, and  
e. Religious belief

- Information is not held regarding the victim of an offence unless the legislation
relating to that offence refers to a specific class of victim (in which case all we hold is
what can be inferred from the use of that offence)

- Information is not held concerning the crime itself except for what can be inferred
from the legislation relating to that offence. Information that is NOT held includes, but
is not limited to:  
a. The location,  
b. The date or timing of the offence,  
c. Whether the offence was carried out online or offline,  
d. Whether a weapon was involved, and if so, what type of weapon,  
e. The relationship of the defendant and victim  

- Information is not held regarding which organisation prosecuted the case e.g. cases
cannot be separately identified as to whether they were prosecuted by the Crown
Prosecution Service, the police or by some other authorised body.

- Because individuals cannot be tracked between courts and cases in the CPD, we are
not able to use it to consider offending histories
